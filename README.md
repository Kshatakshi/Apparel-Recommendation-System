## Features Build 
* Bag of words - A bag-of-words model, or BoW for short, is a way of extracting features from text for use in modeling, such as with machine learning algorithms. A bag-of-words is a representation of text that describes the occurrence of words within a document. It involves two things:
  1.	A vocabulary of known words.
  2.	A measure of the presence of known words.
It is called a “bag” of words, because any information about the order or structure of words in the document is discarded. The model is only concerned with whether known words occur in the document, not where in the document.
*	 Word2Vec - Word2vec is a technique for natural language processing. The word2vec algorithm uses a neural network model to learn word associations from a large corpus of text. Once trained, such a model can detect synonymous words or suggest
additional words for a partial sentence.

*	 CNN - A Convolutional Neural Network (ConvNet/CNN) is a Deep Learning algorithm which can take in an input image, assign importance (learnable weights and biases) to various aspects/objects in the image and be able to differentiate one from the other.
